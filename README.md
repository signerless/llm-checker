## Why LLM Checker?

Choosing the right LLM for your hardware is complex. With thousands of model variants, quantization levels, and hardware configurations, finding the optimal model requires understanding memory bandwidth, VRAM limits, and performance characteristics.

**LLM Checker solves this.** It analyzes your system, scores every compatible model across four dimensions (Quality, Speed, Fit, Context), and delivers actionable recommendations in seconds.

## Comparison with Other Tooling (e.g. `llmfit`)

LLM Checker and `llmfit` solve related but different problems:

| Tool | Primary Focus | Typical Output |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **LLM Checker** | Hardware-aware **model selection** for local inference | Ranked recommendations, compatibility scores, pull/run commands |
| **llmfit** | LLM workflow support and model-fit evaluation from another angle | Different optimization workflow and selection heuristics |

If your goal is: *"What should I run on this exact machine right now?"*, use **LLM Checker** first.  
If your goal is broader experimentation across custom pipelines, using both tools can be complementary.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g llm-checker

# Or run directly with npx
npx llm-checker hw-detect
```

**Termux (Android):**
```bash
pkg update
pkg install ollama
npm install -g llm-checker
```

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+ (tested release lines: 18, 20, 22)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed for running models

The package includes a prebuilt model catalog and declares `sql.js` as an optional dependency for SQLite-powered commands. If your package manager skips optional dependencies and database commands report `sql.js` missing, reinstall with optional dependencies enabled:

```bash
npm install -g llm-checker --include=optional
```

---

## Start Here (2 Minutes)

If you are new, use this exact flow:

```bash
# 1) Install
npm install -g llm-checker

# 2) Detect your hardware
llm-checker hw-detect

# 3) Get recommendations by category
llm-checker recommend --category coding

# 4) Refresh the catalog when you want current Ollama references
llm-checker sync

# 5) Run with auto-selection and tokens/sec metrics
llm-checker ai-run --category coding --prompt "Write a hello world in Python"
```

If you already calibrated routing:

```bash
llm-checker ai-run --calibrated --category coding --prompt "Refactor this function"
```

---

## Distribution

LLM Checker is published in all primary channels:

- npm (latest, recommended): [`llm-checker@latest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/llm-checker)
- GitHub Releases: [Release history](https://github.com/signerless/llm-checker/releases)
- GitHub Packages (legacy mirror, may lag): [`@pavelevich/llm-checker`](https://github.com/users/Pavelevich/packages/npm/package/llm-checker)

### Important: Use npm for Latest Builds

If you need the newest release, install from npm (`llm-checker`), not the scoped GitHub Packages mirror.

If you installed `@pavelevich/llm-checker` and version looks old:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @pavelevich/llm-checker
npm install -g llm-checker@latest
hash -r
llm-checker --version
```

### v3.7.0 Highlights

- New **multi-source model registry**: a packaged snapshot of ~33,700 exact installable/downloadable artifacts from Hugging Face, Ollama, and GPT4All, with per-source commands (`hf download ...`, `ollama pull ...`).
- `recommend` and `check` now draw candidates from the registry through one canonical deterministic scoring core, with `--runtime auto/ollama/vllm/mlx/llama.cpp/transformers` targeting; they fall back to the Ollama catalog when the registry is unavailable.
- New `registry-sync`, `registry-search`, and `registry-recommend` commands.
- Mixture-of-Experts models are sized by their **total** parameter count (all experts stay resident under Ollama/Metal/vLLM), so a large MoE can no longer falsely "fit" small hardware.
- Carries the 3.6.1 batch: unified scoring across `check`/`recommend`/`smart-recommend` (#88), high-end/multi-GPU VRAM detection (#95), MCP server hardening (#97), and the Windows interactive-panel fixes (#86).

### v3.5.13 Highlights

- Ships npm packages with a ready-to-use SQLite model catalog:
  - 229 Ollama models
  - 7176 variants
  - real pull counts and `last_updated` metadata
- `sync` refreshes the local SQLite catalog from Ollama; `recommend`, `list-models`, `ai-run`, and `ai-check` now prefer that synced catalog instead of stale scraper cache data.
- Recommendation normalization was hardened:
  - no more `pulls: 0` for the full catalog after sync
  - `335m` style tags are treated as millions, not billions
  - ambiguous aliases like `latest`, `small`, `medium`, and `large` are not guessed into fake parameter counts
  - cloud variants are filtered out of local recommendations
- `ai-run` streams model responses through Ollama and appends measured tokens/sec so users can compare installed models by real local speed.
- The interactive panel no longer asks for optional parameters before every command.

### v3.3.0 Highlights

- Calibrated routing is now first-class in `recommend` and `ai-run`:
  - `--calibrated [file]` support with default discovery path.
  - clear precedence: `--policy` > `--calibrated` > deterministic fallback.
  - routing provenance output (source, route, selected model).
- New calibration fixtures and end-to-end tests for:
  - `calibrate --policy-out ...` → `recommend --calibrated ...`
- Hardened Jetson CUDA detection to avoid false CPU-only fallback.
- Documentation reorganized under `docs/` with clearer onboarding paths.

### Optional (Legacy): Install from GitHub Packages

Use this only if you explicitly need GitHub Packages. It may not match npm latest.

```bash
# 1) Configure registry + token (PAT with read:packages)
echo "@pavelevich:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}" >> ~/.npmrc

# 2) Install
npm install -g @pavelevich/llm-checker@latest
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Detect your hardware capabilities
llm-checker hw-detect

# 2. Get full analysis with compatible models
llm-checker check

# 3. Get intelligent recommendations by category
llm-checker recommend

# 4. Refresh the catalog when you want current Ollama metadata
llm-checker sync
llm-checker search qwen --use-case coding
```

---

## Calibration Quick Start (10 Minutes)

This path produces both calibration artifacts and verifies calibrated routing in one pass.

### 1) Use the sample prompt suite

```bash
cp ./docs/fixtures/calibration/sample-suite.jsonl ./sample-suite.jsonl
```

### 2) Generate calibration artifacts (dry-run)

```bash
mkdir -p ./artifacts
llm-checker calibrate \
  --suite ./sample-suite.jsonl \
  --models qwen2.5-coder:7b llama3.2:3b \
  --runtime ollama \
  --objective balanced \
  --dry-run \
  --output ./artifacts/calibration-result.json \
  --policy-out ./artifacts/calibration-policy.yaml
```

Artifacts created:

- `./artifacts/calibration-result.json` (calibration contract)
- `./artifacts/calibration-policy.yaml` (routing policy for runtime commands)

### 3) Apply calibrated routing

```bash
llm-checker recommend --calibrated ./artifacts/calibration-policy.yaml --category coding
llm-checker ai-run --calibrated ./artifacts/calibration-policy.yaml --category coding --prompt "Refactor this function"
```

Notes:

- `--policy <file>` has precedence over `--calibrated [file]`.
- If `--calibrated` has no path, discovery uses `~/.llm-checker/calibration-policy.{yaml,yml,json}`.
- `--mode full` currently requires `--runtime ollama`.
- `./docs/fixtures/calibration/sample-generated-policy.yaml` shows the expected policy structure.

---

## MCP Server (Claude, Codex, Grok, Kimi, Cursor, Gemini...)

LLM Checker includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server, allowing **any MCP-compatible AI assistant** — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Grok, Kimi Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI — to analyze your hardware and manage local models directly.

### Setup (One Command)

```bash
# Install globally first
npm install -g llm-checker

# Print (or apply) the setup for your client
llm-checker mcp-setup --client claude    # default; claude mcp add ...
llm-checker mcp-setup --client codex     # ~/.codex/config.toml
llm-checker mcp-setup --client grok      # ~/.grok/config.toml
llm-checker mcp-setup --client kimi      # ~/.kimi/mcp.json
llm-checker mcp-setup --client cursor    # ~/.cursor/mcp.json
llm-checker mcp-setup --client windsurf  # ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
llm-checker mcp-setup --client gemini    # ~/.gemini/settings.json
llm-checker mcp-setup --client generic   # raw mcpServers JSON for any client
```

`--apply` merges the server entry into the client's config file (existing
content is never clobbered), and `--json` prints the structured snippet for
scripting. `--npx` avoids a global server install by generating the explicit
package-qualified command below (the executable is part of `llm-checker`; there
is no separate `llm-checker-mcp` npm package):

```bash
npx --yes --package llm-checker llm-checker-mcp
```

Restart your client and you're done.

### Available MCP Tools

- *"Clean up my Ollama — what should I remove?"*
- *"What model should I use for this Rust project?"*
- *"Optimize my Ollama config for maximum performance"*
- *"How much RAM is Ollama using right now?"*

- *"Verify the blob of the model I just downloaded before running it"*

Your assistant will automatically call the right tools and give you actionable results.

---

## Interactive CLI Panel

Running `llm-checker` with no arguments now opens an interactive panel (TTY terminals):

- animated startup banner
- main command list with descriptions
- type `/` to open all commands
- use up/down arrows to select a command
- press `Enter` to execute
- add optional extra flags before run (example: `--json --limit 5`)

For scripting and automation, direct command invocation remains unchanged:

```bash
llm-checker check --use-case coding --limit 3
llm-checker search "qwen coder" --json
```

---

## Commands

### Core Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hw-detect` | Detect GPU/CPU capabilities, memory, backends |

### `verify` — Model File Safety Validation

```bash
llm-checker verify ~/.ollama/models/blobs/sha256-abc123...
llm-checker verify ./model.safetensors --json
```

`verify` is powered by [ModelVet](https://github.com/tetsuo-ai/modelvet), the
structural safety validator for GGUF and safetensors developed by
[Tetsuo AI](https://github.com/tetsuo-ai). LLM Checker packages ModelVet as
WebAssembly and integrates it with the CLI, Ollama verification gates,
policies, and MCP, keeping verification offline and free of native
dependencies.

It answers one question before any model loader touches a file: *is this file
structurally safe to load?* Every file-derived length, count, offset, and
tensor size is checked with overflow-safe arithmetic, in fixed memory.

```
=== Model Verification (modelvet) ===
File:      ./suspicious.gguf
Format:    gguf (0.12 GiB)
Verdict:   REJECT
Violation: TENSOR_DATA_EXTENT (code 311)
Offset:    0x1a4f2
```

Exit codes mirror the modelvet CLI contract: `0` = ACCEPT, `1` = REJECT,
`2` = no verdict (error), so it drops directly into CI gates and scripts.

An ACCEPT verdict is **structural only**: it says nothing about model
behavior, provenance, or poisoned weights. Files above 3 GiB exceed the
wasm32 memory ceiling; use the native modelvet CLI for those.

#### Verification Gates in Ollama Flows

The same verifier is wired into the Ollama workflows as an opt-in gate:

```bash
# Verify every installed model's local blob while ranking them
llm-checker installed --verify
llm-checker installed --verify --json

# Verify the selected model's blob after pull, before running it
llm-checker ai-run --verify --category coding --prompt "Refactor this function"

# Explicitly continue only if verification is unavailable (never on REJECT)
llm-checker ai-run --verify --allow-unverified --category coding --prompt "Refactor this function"
```

- `installed --verify` adds a per-model verification status (verified /
  REJECTED with the violation name / skipped with reason). Any REJECT exits `1`.
- `ai-run --verify` is fail-closed: a REJECTED blob exits `1` with an
  `ollama rm` hint, while a missing/unreadable blob, verifier error, or file
  above the 3 GiB wasm32 ceiling exits `2` without running the model.
- `--allow-unverified` is an explicit escape hatch for the no-verdict cases
  above. It requires `--verify` and can never bypass a ModelVet REJECT.
- Blob resolution reads the Ollama manifest store (`$OLLAMA_MODELS` or
  `~/.ollama/models`), so no Ollama API changes are needed.

#### Structural Validation in Policies

Enterprise policies can require modelvet validation with the
`structural_validation` rule:

```yaml
rules:
  structural_validation:
    enabled: true
    on_unverifiable: warn   # warn | fail (default warn)
```

- In `audit` mode a REJECTED local model is reported as a
  `STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION_FAILED` violation; in `enforce` mode it blocks
  (non-zero exit). Catalog-only candidates with no local file are reported as
  `not_applicable`, never as violations.
- `on_unverifiable: fail` also turns verifier errors (missing WASM artifact,
  files over 3 GiB, unreadable blobs) into blocking
  `STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION_UNVERIFIABLE` violations.
- `audit export` reports (JSON/CSV/SARIF) carry a `verification` field per
  finding — `{ verdict, violation_code, violation_name, offset }` — using the
  same "unknown, never omitted" convention as the provenance fields, so
  downstream parsers stay deterministic.

### Database Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sync` | Refresh the local SQLite model catalog from Ollama |
| `search <query>` | Search the synced Ollama catalog; add `--registry`/`--source` to search the multi-source registry (HF + Ollama + GPT4All) with `--max-params`/`--runtime`/`--format` filters |
| `smart-recommend` | Advanced recommendations using the full scoring engine |

### Model Registry Commands (v3.7.0+)

Exact installable/downloadable artifacts from a packaged multi-source registry (Hugging Face + Ollama + GPT4All).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `registry-sync` | Sync the multi-source registry (Hugging Face, Ollama, GPT4All) |
| `registry-search [query]` | Search exact artifacts with `--source`, `--format`, `--runtime`, `--quant`, `--max-size`, `--min-params`/`--max-params` filters |
| `registry-recommend [query]` | Recommend the best exact artifacts for your hardware, with `--runtime auto/ollama/vllm/mlx/llama.cpp/transformers` targeting and `--category`/`--optimize` |

```bash
# Best coding artifacts across all sources, auto runtime
llm-checker registry-recommend --category coding

# Only Apple-native MLX artifacts
llm-checker registry-recommend --category coding --runtime mlx

# Search Hugging Face for vLLM-ready reasoning models under 24B
llm-checker registry-search qwen --source huggingface --runtime vllm --max-params 24
```

### Enterprise Policy Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `policy init` | Generate a `policy.yaml` template for enterprise governance |
| `policy validate` | Validate a policy file and return non-zero on schema errors |
| `audit export` | Evaluate policy outcomes and export compliance reports (`json`, `csv`, `sarif`) |

### Policy Enforcement in `check` and `recommend`

Both `check` and `recommend` support `--policy <file>`.

- In `audit` mode, policy violations are reported but the command exits with `0`.
- In `enforce` mode, blocking violations return non-zero (default `1`).
- You can override the non-zero code with `enforcement.exit_code` in `policy.yaml`.

Examples:

```bash
llm-checker check --policy ./policy.yaml
llm-checker check --policy ./policy.yaml --use-case coding --runtime vllm
llm-checker recommend --policy ./policy.yaml --category coding
```

### Calibrated Routing in `recommend` and `ai-run`

`recommend` and `ai-run` now support calibration routing policies generated by `calibrate --policy-out`.

- `--calibrated [file]`:
  - If `file` is omitted, discovery defaults to `~/.llm-checker/calibration-policy.{yaml,yml,json}`.
- `--policy <file>` takes precedence over `--calibrated` for routing resolution.
- Resolution precedence:
  - `--policy` (explicit)
  - `--calibrated` (explicit file or default discovery)
  - deterministic selector fallback
- CLI output includes routing provenance (`--policy`, `--calibrated`, or default discovery) and the selected route/model.

Examples:

```bash
llm-checker recommend --calibrated --category coding
llm-checker recommend --calibrated ./calibration-policy.yaml --category reasoning
llm-checker ai-run --calibrated --category coding --prompt "Refactor this function"
llm-checker ai-run --policy ./calibration-policy.yaml --prompt "Summarize this report"
```

### Policy Audit Export

Use `audit export` when you need machine-readable compliance evidence for CI/CD gates, governance reviews, or security tooling.

```bash
# Single report format
llm-checker audit export --policy ./policy.yaml --command check --format json --out ./reports/check-policy.json

# Export all configured formats (json, csv, sarif)
llm-checker audit export --policy ./policy.yaml --command check --format all --out-dir ./reports
```

- `--command check|recommend` chooses the candidate source.
- `--format all` honors `reporting.formats` in your policy (falls back to `json,csv,sarif`).
- In `enforce` mode with blocking violations, reports are still written before non-zero exit.

### Integration Examples (SIEM / CI Artifacts)

```bash
# CI artifact (JSON) for post-processing in pipeline jobs
llm-checker audit export --policy ./policy.yaml --command check --format json --out ./reports/policy-report.json

# Flat CSV for SIEM ingestion (Splunk/ELK/DataDog pipelines)
llm-checker audit export --policy ./policy.yaml --command check --format csv --out ./reports/policy-report.csv

# SARIF for security/code-scanning tooling integrations
llm-checker audit export --policy ./policy.yaml --command check --format sarif --out ./reports/policy-report.sarif
```

### GitHub Actions Policy Gate (Copy-Paste)

```yaml
name: Policy Gate
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  policy-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: node bin/enhanced_cli.js check --policy ./policy.yaml --runtime ollama --no-verbose
      - if: always()
        run: node bin/enhanced_cli.js audit export --policy ./policy.yaml --command check --format all --runtime ollama --no-verbose --out-dir ./policy-reports
      - if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: policy-audit-reports
          path: ./policy-reports
```

### Provenance Fields in Reports

`check`, `recommend`, and `audit export` outputs include normalized model provenance fields:

- `source`
- `registry`
- `version`
- `license`
- `digest`

If a field is unavailable from model metadata, outputs use `"unknown"` instead of omitting the field. This keeps downstream parsers deterministic.
License values are canonicalized for policy checks (for example `MIT License` -> `mit`, `Apache 2.0` -> `apache-2.0`).

### AI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ai-check` | AI-powered model evaluation with meta-analysis |
| `ai-run` | AI-powered model selection and execution with live tokens/sec output |

---

### `ai-run` &mdash; Auto-Select and Run

```bash
llm-checker ai-run --category coding --prompt "Write a file parser in Node.js"
llm-checker ai-run --benchmark --category general
llm-checker ai-run --reference-only --category reasoning
```

`ai-run` chooses the best installed model for the requested category, falls back to the best local alternative when the top catalog pick is not installed, and streams through Ollama directly.

When a response completes, the CLI appends measured local speed:

```text
>>> hi
Hello! How can I help you today?

### `hw-detect` &mdash; Hardware Analysis

```bash
llm-checker hw-detect
```

```
Summary:
  Apple M4 Pro (24GB Unified Memory)
  Tier: MEDIUM HIGH
  Max model size: 15GB
  Best backend: metal

CPU:
  Apple M4 Pro
  Cores: 12 (12 physical)
  SIMD: NEON

Metal:
  GPU Cores: 16
  Unified Memory: 24GB
  Memory Bandwidth: 273GB/s
```

On hybrid or integrated-only systems, `hw-detect` now also surfaces GPU topology explicitly:

```
Dedicated GPUs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060
Integrated GPUs: Intel Iris Xe Graphics
Assist path: Integrated/shared-memory GPU detected, runtime remains CPU
```

This makes integrated GPUs visible even when the selected runtime backend is still CPU.

### `recommend` &mdash; Category Recommendations

```bash
llm-checker recommend
```

As of the scoring unification (#96), `check`, `recommend`, and `smart-recommend`
all derive their ranking from **one canonical scoring core**
(`DeterministicModelSelector` via `src/models/scoring-core.js`), so identical
`(model, hardware)` inputs score identically across all three and the
high-capacity right-sizing floor applies everywhere. They differ only in their
model **source** and **presentation**, not in how a given model is ranked:

| Command | Role | Ranking core |
|---------|------|--------------|
| `recommend` | Canonical model recommendations by category | Shared core (reference output) |
| `check` | Full hardware-compatibility report with a recommendation card | Shared core (consistent ranking, fit-oriented report) |
| `smart-recommend` | Catalog/DB-backed recommendations with a detailed score breakdown | Shared core (same ordering + scores) |

Use optimization profiles to steer ranking by intent:

```bash
llm-checker recommend --optimize balanced
llm-checker recommend --optimize speed
llm-checker recommend --optimize quality
llm-checker recommend --optimize context
llm-checker recommend --optimize coding
```

```
INTELLIGENT RECOMMENDATIONS BY CATEGORY
Hardware Tier: HIGH | Models Analyzed: 205

Coding:
   qwen2.5-coder:14b (14B)
   Score: 78/100
   Fine-tuning: LoRA+QLoRA
   Command: ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b

Reasoning:
   deepseek-r1:14b (14B)
   Score: 86/100
   Fine-tuning: QLoRA
   Command: ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b

   Score: 83/100
   Fine-tuning: LoRA+QLoRA
   Command: ollama pull llama3.2-vision:11b
```

`check`, `recommend`, and `ai-check` include a fine-tuning suitability label in output to help choose between Full FT, LoRA, and QLoRA paths.

### `search` &mdash; Model Search

```bash
llm-checker search llama -l 5
llm-checker search coding --use-case coding
llm-checker search qwen --quant Q4_K_M --max-size 8
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-l, --limit <n>` | Number of results (default: 10) |
| `-u, --use-case <type>` | Optimize for: `general`, `coding`, `chat`, `reasoning`, `creative`, `fast` |
| `--max-size <gb>` | Maximum model size in GB |
| `--quant <type>` | Filter by quantization: `Q4_K_M`, `Q8_0`, `FP16`, etc. |
| `--family <name>` | Filter by model family |

---

## Model Catalog

LLM Checker ships with a pre-synced SQLite snapshot of the Ollama catalog plus a multi-source registry of exact downloadable/installable model artifacts. On first run, that snapshot is copied to `~/.llm-checker/models.db`, so recommendations and catalog search work immediately after npm install.

The packaged snapshot currently includes:

- 229 Ollama models
- 7176 variants
- 3259 multi-source registry repositories
- 33729 exact model artifacts from Hugging Face, Ollama, and GPT4All
- Hugging Face top 3000 repositories by downloads, fetched with API pagination
- pull counts
- tag counts
- last-updated metadata
- variant params, quantization, size, context, runtime, install commands, download URLs, license/gated flags, tasks, and modalities when available

Refresh it any time:

```bash
llm-checker sync
llm-checker registry-sync --sources ollama,huggingface,gpt4all
llm-checker registry-search qwen --runtime auto --max-size 8
llm-checker registry-recommend --category coding --runtime auto --max-size 8
```

For release maintainers, the packaged seed can be regenerated from the synced local DB and registry APIs:

```bash
npm run sync:seed
```

`recommend`, `list-models`, `ai-run`, and `ai-check` prefer the synced SQLite catalog. `registry-search` queries exact artifacts across sources, and `registry-recommend` ranks exact artifacts from the registry with the deterministic hardware-aware selector. If the SQLite catalog is unavailable, LLM Checker falls back to the scraped cache and then to the curated catalog.

The curated fallback catalog includes 35+ models from the most popular Ollama families:

| Family | Models | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Qwen 2.5/3** | 7B, 14B, Coder 7B/14B/32B, VL 3B/7B | Coding, general, vision |
| **Llama 3.x** | 1B, 3B, 8B, Vision 11B | General, chat, multimodal |
| **DeepSeek** | R1 8B/14B/32B, Coder V2 16B | Reasoning, coding |
| **Phi-4** | 14B | Reasoning, math |
| **Gemma 2** | 2B, 9B | General, efficient |
| **Mistral** | 7B, Nemo 12B | Creative, chat |
| **CodeLlama** | 7B, 13B | Coding |
| **LLaVA** | 7B, 13B | Vision |
| **Embeddings** | nomic-embed-text, mxbai-embed-large, bge-m3, all-minilm | RAG, search |

All available models are automatically combined with locally installed Ollama models for scoring. Ambiguous tags such as `latest`, cloud-only variants, and aliases without reliable size metadata are kept out of local recommendations unless they can be resolved to concrete parameters or artifact sizes.

---

## Scoring System

Models are evaluated across four dimensions, weighted by use case:

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Q** Quality | Model family reputation + parameter count + quantization penalty |
| **S** Speed | Estimated tokens/sec based on hardware backend and model size |
| **F** Fit | Memory utilization efficiency (how well it fits in available RAM) |
| **C** Context | Context window capability vs. target context length |

### Scoring Weights by Use Case

Three scoring systems are available, each optimized for different workflows:

**Deterministic Selector** (primary &mdash; used by `check` and `recommend`):

| Category | Quality | Speed | Fit | Context |
|----------|:-------:|:-----:|:---:|:-------:|
| `general` | 45% | 35% | 15% | 5% |
| `coding` | 55% | 20% | 15% | 10% |
| `reasoning` | 60% | 10% | 20% | 10% |
| `multimodal` | 50% | 15% | 20% | 15% |

**Scoring Engine** (used by `search` for catalog scoring; `smart-recommend`'s final ranking is produced by the shared scoring core &mdash; see #96):

| Use Case | Quality | Speed | Fit | Context |
|----------|:-------:|:-----:|:---:|:-------:|
| `general` | 40% | 35% | 15% | 10% |
| `coding` | 55% | 20% | 15% | 10% |
| `reasoning` | 60% | 15% | 10% | 15% |
| `chat` | 40% | 40% | 15% | 5% |
| `fast` | 25% | 55% | 15% | 5% |
| `quality` | 65% | 10% | 15% | 10% |

All weights are centralized in `src/models/scoring-config.js`.

### Memory Estimation

Memory requirements are calculated using calibrated bytes-per-parameter values:

| Quantization | Bytes/Param | 7B Model | 14B Model | 32B Model |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Q8_0 | 1.05 | ~8 GB | ~16 GB | ~35 GB |
| Q4_K_M | 0.58 | ~5 GB | ~9 GB | ~20 GB |
| Q3_K | 0.48 | ~4 GB | ~8 GB | ~17 GB |

The selector automatically picks the best quantization that fits your available memory.

For MoE models, deterministic memory estimation supports explicit sparse metadata when present:

- `total_params_b`
- `active_params_b`
- `expert_count`
- `experts_active_per_token`

Normalized recommendation variants expose both snake_case and camelCase metadata aliases
(for example: `total_params_b` + `totalParamsB`) when available.

MoE parameter path selection is deterministic and uses this fallback order:

1. `active_params_b` (assumption source: `moe_active_metadata`)
2. `total_params_b * (experts_active_per_token / expert_count)` (assumption source: `moe_derived_expert_ratio`)
3. `total_params_b` (assumption source: `moe_fallback_total_params`)
4. Model `paramsB` fallback (assumption source: `moe_fallback_model_params`)

Dense models continue to use the dense parameter path (`dense_params`) unchanged.

When `active_params_b` (or a derived active-ratio path) is available, inference memory
uses the sparse-active parameter estimate even if artifact size metadata is present.

### Runtime-Aware MoE Speed Estimation

MoE speed estimates now include runtime-specific overhead assumptions (routing, communication, offload), instead of using a single fixed MoE boost.

- Canonical helper: `src/models/moe-assumptions.js`
- Applied in both:
  - `src/models/deterministic-selector.js`
  - `src/models/scoring-engine.js`

Current runtime profiles:

| Runtime | Routing | Communication | Offload | Max Effective Gain |
|:--------|:-------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:------------------:|
| `ollama` | 18% | 13% | 8% | 2.35x |
| `vllm` | 12% | 8% | 4% | 2.65x |
| `mlx` | 16% | 10% | 5% | 2.45x |
| `llama.cpp` | 20% | 14% | 9% | 2.30x |

Recommendation outputs now expose these assumptions through runtime metadata and MoE speed diagnostics.

## Architecture

LLM Checker uses a deterministic pipeline so the same inputs produce the same ranked output, with explicit policy outcomes for governance workflows.

### Component Responsibilities

- **Input layer**: Collects runtime constraints from hardware detection, local inventory, dynamic registry data, and CLI flags.
- **Normalization layer**: Deduplicates identifiers/tags and builds a canonical candidate set.
- **Selection layer**: Filters by use case, selects the best fitting quantization, and computes deterministic Q/S/F/C scores.
- **Governance layer**: Applies policy rules in `audit` or `enforce` mode and records explicit violation metadata.
- **Output layer**: Returns ranked recommendations plus machine-readable compliance artifacts when requested.

### Execution Stages

1. **Hardware profiling**: Detect CPU/GPU/RAM and effective backend capabilities.
2. **Model pool assembly**: Merge the synced SQLite catalog (or fallback cache/catalog) with locally installed models.
3. **Candidate filtering**: Keep only relevant models for the requested use case.
4. **Fit selection**: Choose the best quantization for available memory budget.
5. **Deterministic scoring**: Score each candidate across quality, speed, fit, and context.
6. **Policy + ranking**: Apply optional policy checks, then rank and return actionable commands.
